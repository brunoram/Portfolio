# Portfolio
There you can find 5 of my projects about WEB PROGRAMMING:
-hw-master is my first university project about a library-search system including Google Books APIs;
-blog is the "translation" of hw project, in Laravel framework;
-oratorio is a simple offline management application created for a children oratory.
The other two are realised on AWS, one it's a portfolio template and the other a simple Lambda HTTP API which sends and receive data from Dynamo DB
